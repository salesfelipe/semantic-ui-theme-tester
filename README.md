# semantic-ui-theme-tester

A simple environment for developing themes using Semantic-ui.

This is a project for those who are new to the semantic-ui theming world. I've started this project because I had a hard time getting started on this topic. 

## The idea:

On the 'test-page.html' file you have many semantic-ui components already displayed, so you can just edit your theme, run 'gulp build' and then you can check the results by opening the file test-page.html. The css and javascprit of this file are linked to the ones on semantic/dist, so every time that you build your theme this file will display the newest changes for you.

## Requirements:

You should have installed:

- gulp
- node/npm
